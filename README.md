This tool can used to map FNF songs easier in osu or can be used to just import a song from osu.<br/>
Mapping a song in osu:
1. Open the song and setup in 8K
2. Map the right side as player1 and map the left side as player2 with 4 keys for each player
3. After mapping the song save and open the .osu beatmap located in the osu!\Songs folder
4. Copy and paste the contents of the .osu beatmap into the converter
5. Adjust any options you need to change and convert
6. Copy the result into the JSON file in FNF which is located in assets\preload\data\\(song name)
7. Test the map in FNF
If the map is not working make sure you added the correct song name in options which is the same as the folder in assets\songs
<br/>
Extra info:<br/>
- The converter can take 4K maps but turn on the only player1 option for it to be mapped the same
