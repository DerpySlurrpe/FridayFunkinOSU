NOTICE

barley working on depending on how this goes

Hoping The Creator
Can help me on this if he pleases
I DEFINITLY NEED HELP If you want to help make sure to open a issue so i can know(yeah that how its gonna go)
Things you can do
Osu to Lua Script Most Importantly Need Work On 
Osu to lua needs a updated Output scheme on the code (i think that will fix the crashing) because i think it trying to detect something but can't find 


*Things I Did So Far*

Added A gfVersion Text Thingie to the site maybe it might need that somehow
gfVersion still needs to be implemented in the osu/lua code it been put in the website but not functional



This tool can used to map FNF songs easier in osu or can be used to just import a song from osu.<br/>
Mapping a song in osu:
1. Open the song and setup in 8K
2. Map the right side as player1 and map the left side as player2 with 4 keys for each player
3. After mapping the song save and open the .osu beatmap located in the osu!\Songs folder
4. Copy and paste the contents of the .osu beatmap into the converter
5. Adjust any options you need to change and convert
6. Copy the result into the JSON file in FNF which is located in assets\preload\data\\(song name)
7. Test the map in FNF
If the map is not working make sure you added the correct song name in options which is the same as the folder in assets\songs
<br/>
Extra info:<br/>
- The converter can take 4K maps but turn on the only player1 option for it to be mapped the same
